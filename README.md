# Transport-for-London-Cycle-Recommendations
Assignment for London School of Economics group employer project for Thoughtworks

Scenario: Having outlined the transport strategy for the next two decades in 2018, the Mayor of London has hired Thoughtworks to consult on how much progress has been made and ask for recommendations as to whether anything in the strategy needs to be adjusted. They are particularly interested in the changes in cycling behaviour and its impact on the overall strategy.
